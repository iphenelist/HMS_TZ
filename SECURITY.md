## Security Best Practices

When developing with HMS TZ:

1. **Always use Frappe's ORM** - Avoid raw SQL queries
2. **Validate user input** - Use Frappe's built-in validation
3. **Check permissions** - Use `frappe.has_permission()`
4. **Sanitize output** - Use `frappe.utils.escape_html()` when needed
5. **Avoid `eval()` and `exec()`** - Use safer alternatives
