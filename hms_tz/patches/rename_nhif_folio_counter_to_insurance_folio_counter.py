    """PRE-MODEL-SYNC: Rename NHIF Folio Counter → Insurance Folio Counter and backfill records.

    All three steps run before model sync:

    Step A — Rename the DocType (idempotent, guarded by existence check):
        frappe.rename_doc() handles:
          - Renaming the row in tabDocType
          - Renaming the DB table (tabNHIF Folio Counter → tabInsurance Folio Counter)
          - Updating all Link field values pointing to the old name

    Step B — Add the insurance_provider column manually:
        Since this patch runs before model sync, the new column from
        insurance_folio_counter.json does not exist yet. We add it here so
        the backfill in Step C can succeed immediately.
        Model sync will later sync the full column definition (label, options,
        reqd, etc.) — adding a column that already exists is a no-op.

    Step C — Backfill insurance_provider = 'NHIF' on all pre-existing records:
        Every record that existed before this rename was created by the NHIF
        integration, so all of them receive insurance_provider = 'NHIF'.

    Idempotent: all steps are guarded so repeated bench migrate is safe.
